# LAZAREV Clone — Tailwind / GSAP / Locomotive Project

> **Personal learning clone** of the Lazarev agency landing page. Built to practice Tailwind utilities, GSAP animations and Locomotive Scroll. This is **not** an official Lazarev project.

[Live Demo](https://faridhussain.github.io/Lazarev/)

## About

This is a single-page HTML prototype recreating the Lazarev landing experience for hands-on learning. It mixes Tailwind (via CDN), plain CSS and JS with GSAP and Locomotive for smooth scroll + animated interactions.

## Tech Stack

- HTML (single `index.html`)
- Tailwind (via `@tailwindcss/browser` CDN for prototyping)
- GSAP (animations & ScrollTrigger)
- Locomotive Scroll (smooth scrolling)
- Remixicon (icons)
- Small custom CSS for tweaks

## What I wanted to learn

- Replace hand-written CSS with Tailwind utilities
- Basics of GSAP timelines, hover + scroll animations, ScrollTrigger
- Integrate Locomotive Scroll with GSAP (scrollerProxy)
- Structure long single-page layouts and manage entrance/hover interactions

## Features Implemented

- Multi-section landing layout (pages 1–10)
- Sticky top navigation with GSAP-driven expansion on hover
- Infinite logo carousel (CSS keyframe)
- Playable showreel video overlay with GSAP transforms
- Hover cards with overlay reveal and transitions
- Locomotive Scroll + GSAP ScrollTrigger integration
